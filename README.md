# Labable - Laundry Shop Management System
A modern, efficient, and student-centered web and mobile platform for small to medium-sized laundry shops.

# Introduction and Problem Solved
The Challenge with Traditional Laundry Services
Most small to medium-sized laundry shops near university areas still rely on manual, traditional processes like handwritten logbooks for order tracking, payment recording, and scheduling. This results in:

1. Inefficiency and Errors: High risk of human error, data loss (misplaced or damaged papers), and inconsistency in records.
2. Difficult Management: Staff struggle to perform basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on records, making sales report generation and customer history tracking difficult.
3. Customer Inconvenience: Customers often face long waiting times and must physically visit the shop to check their order status due to a lack of clear communication.

# The Labable Solution
The Labable Laundry Shop Management System (LMS) is designed to mitigate these difficulties by offering a convenient web and mobile-based platform. It specifically targets the time-constrained students of Bulacan State University and the general public, providing a modern alternative that streamlines operations for the business owner and enhances the service experience for the client.

# Target Users
The system is designed to serve three main groups:

1. Customers (Students & General Public): Individuals residing near campus (dormitories, apartments) who need a fast, reliable, and convenient way to manage their laundry, including scheduling services, pick-up/delivery, and tracking.
2. Laundry Shop Staff/Administrators: The individuals responsible for processing customer orders, updating service records, and ensuring the smooth flow of daily operations.
3. Laundry Shop Owner: The primary user for overseeing overall business operations, monitoring performance, and generating crucial sales and income reports.

# Key Features (Purpose and Description)
Labable combines Transaction Processing System (TPS) and Management Information System (MIS) features to ensure both operational efficiency and insightful reporting.

# Customer & Staff Features (TPS)
- Service Scheduling: Allows customers to easily schedule laundry services and choose between pick-up and delivery options.

# Owner & Management Features (MIS)

- Report Generation: Provides tools for generating sales reports, monitoring income, and analyzing business performance.
- Integrated Dashboard: Offers a summarized view of key business information for quick monitoring.
