# Labable - Laundry Shop Management System

# Introduction
The primary target users of the proposed system are the students of Bulacan State University who temporarily reside in dormitories, apartments and boarding houses near the campus; these students have limited time to do laundry because of their academic responsibilities. In addition, the system also caters the general public who require laundry services to manage not only their clothes but also other washable items. 
The system also serves the laundry shop owner, who oversees the overall business operations and monitoring. The laundry shop staff are also among the target users, as they are expected to be the administrators who are responsible for processing customer orders, updating records, and ensuring smooth flow of services.
Most laundry shops today, particularly small to medium-sized businesses near universities and residential areas, are still relying on traditional ways of processing and managing daily business operations. These processes include handwritten order tracking, manual recording of customer details, and physical monitoring of payment and delivery schedules. Those traditional manual practices often lead to inefficiency, human error, data loss due to misplaced papers or paper tearing, and delays in service, especially during peak hours when multiple transactions and customers occur simultaneously.
For instance, many laundry shop owners record customer information, laundry load information and payment details on logbooks or notebooks. When these records have been accumulated, retrieving specific information from logbooks or notebooks becomes very difficult, resulting in confusion, inconsistency, misplaced records, inaccuracy and inefficient tracking of records. Also this kind of system poses many problems or issues in generating sales reports, monitoring income, and tracking customer histories.
The laundry service is a vital part of the daily routine of students who temporarily reside in dormitories, apartments and boarding houses, and other clients who rely on this kind of service due to limited free time to do laundry. However, many of them experience long waiting time, and unclear communication about their order status, this issues mostly occured because the customers obliged to visit the shop to physically check about their laundry status, causing inconvenience and wasted time and effort.
From the administrator or the staff perspectives, manual record-keeping makes it difficult to perform (CRUD operations) the create, read, update and delete, or locate orders, leading to human errors in laundry handling, delayed deliveries and services, and sometimes leads to customer dissatisfaction due to inconvenience. They also have to manually compute payments and update receipts, which increases the risk of calculation mistakes.

# Project Context
  A significant portion of Bulacan State University students reside in dormitories, boarding houses, and apartments near the campus. Due to busy schedules and limited resources, many students struggle to manage their laundry items. The proposed Laundry Management System (LMS) addresses this by providing a convenient web and mobile-based management system that allows students and the general public to easily schedule laundry services, schedule pick-up and delivery services, track their orders, and process payments anytime.
Unlike existing laundry management systems that are designed mainly for large-scale operations, the proposed LMS is simple, affordable, and tailored for small local laundry shops catering to students and the general public. It offers real-time tracking, automated cost computation, and integrated dashboards for administrators. The system also combines Transaction Processing System (TPS) and Management Information System (MIS) features, enabling efficient daily transactions, report generation, and business performance monitoring.
The proposed LMS provides a modern, student-centered, and efficient solution that streamlines operations for laundry shop owners and staff while offering users a faster, more reliable, and accessible laundry service experience.

# General Objectives
  The  main objective of the study is to design and develop a mobile and web-based  Laundry Shop Management (LMS) System for students, more specifically Bulacan State University’s college students but available also for the general public that will mitigate the difficulties of managing laundry due to time constraint and lack of equipment so that people allocate their time on different activities.

# Purpose and Description
  The main purpose of this project is to create a system that will assist the students of Bulacan State University by providing a system that will conveniently manage their laundry through the Laundry Shop Management (LMS) System. Through this system, students are expected to face less hassle in handling their own laundry, allowing them to focus more of their time and attention on their academic or personal responsibilities.
The TPS (Transaction Processing System) features of the LMS allow students to schedule their laundry, track its progress, and choose between pick-up and delivery options. The system also supports both cash and cashless payment methods and automatically generates receipts for each transaction. The MIS (Management Information System) features focus on organizing and managing collected data by sorting, summarizing, and classifying records, generating reports, dashboard generation to view a summary of key information, and providing a search function for viewing laundry histories. 
In summary, these subsystems make the system a comprehensive and efficient platform for students to use as it provides real-time update and transparent tracking. The system also seeks to provide a more modern approach as opposed to the traditional and manual laundry process by offering a convenient and technologically advanced alternative customized for the students of Bulacan State University and its community.
