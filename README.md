# Labable - Laundry Shop Management System

# Introduction
The continuous advancement of technology has greatly improved the business operations and automations, specifically for laundry industries by transforming traditional manual operations into efficient and automated systems. The use of web-based and mobile app-based laundry management systems allows businesses to easily track, create and manage orders, also include efficient payment handling, and conveniently manage customer information. This technological innovation reduces human errors, increases productivity and enhances customer satisfaction through real-time and faster service delivery. As a result, through utilizing current technological trends in laundry shops businesses can now provide a more reliable, and organized way of services while being competitive in the modern digital market.
Laundry shops are becoming somewhat of a necessity for different countries. According to the Grand View Research (2024), the market size for the laundry services market in the year 2024 was estimated at around USD 78.20 billion and is only expected to rise up to USD 118.71 billion by the year 2030. Lebanon, despite the drastic gender equality, shows an optimistic view of laundry services, especially e-laundry services like Ondro (Abdel Nour, 2021). In the United States, the laundry service is used by approximately 22.4 million users, yearly (Abdel Nour, 2021).
	Laundry shops are also prevalent in Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam (Hoang, 2022), Thailand (Moon et al., 2019), and Indonesia (Wibowo & Santoso, 2021). The service has always been popular and only received a massive rise in demand during the COVID pandemic. Hoang (2022) states that laundry shops are more effective, especially for people that do not have enough time in their hands. It allows them to allocate their time to other activities. With the intricacy of washing clothes and the care it needs to tend to each of them, it is all the more reason why people seek services like laundry shops to do it for them. Laundry shops need to keep track of customer information, laundry and clothes records, schedules, and the delivery and retrieval options when using their service (Adekola et al., 2021). With the transition of manual operations to automated systems, these will be streamlined, boosting the business’ overall efficiency.

The primary target users of the proposed system are the students of Bulacan State University who temporarily reside in dormitories, apartments and boarding houses near the campus; these students have limited time to do laundry because of their academic responsibilities. In addition, the system also caters the general public who require laundry services to manage not only their clothes but also other washable items. 
The system also serves the laundry shop owner, who oversees the overall business operations and monitoring. The laundry shop staff are also among the target users, as they are expected to be the administrators who are responsible for processing customer orders, updating records, and ensuring smooth flow of services.
Most laundry shops today, particularly small to medium-sized businesses near universities and residential areas, are still relying on traditional ways of processing and managing daily business operations. These processes include handwritten order tracking, manual recording of customer details, and physical monitoring of payment and delivery schedules. Those traditional manual practices often lead to inefficiency, human error, data loss due to misplaced papers or paper tearing, and delays in service, especially during peak hours when multiple transactions and customers occur simultaneously.
For instance, many laundry shop owners record customer information, laundry load information and payment details on logbooks or notebooks. When these records have been accumulated, retrieving specific information from logbooks or notebooks becomes very difficult, resulting in confusion, inconsistency, misplaced records, inaccuracy and inefficient tracking of records. Also this kind of system poses many problems or issues in generating sales reports, monitoring income, and tracking customer histories.
The laundry service is a vital part of the daily routine of students who temporarily reside in dormitories, apartments and boarding houses, and other clients who rely on this kind of service due to limited free time to do laundry. However, many of them experience long waiting time, and unclear communication about their order status, this issues mostly occured because the customers obliged to visit the shop to physically check about their laundry status, causing inconvenience and wasted time and effort.
From the administrator or the staff perspectives, manual record-keeping makes it difficult to perform (CRUD operations) the create, read, update and delete, or locate orders, leading to human errors in laundry handling, delayed deliveries and services, and sometimes leads to customer dissatisfaction due to inconvenience. They also have to manually compute payments and update receipts, which increases the risk of calculation mistakes.
Meanwhile, the business owner faces challenges in monitoring daily business operations, sales reports and tracking the performance of the business. In addition, the lack of a database or digital system for record-keeping prevents the owner from maintaining accurate customer records, assessing business performance, and monitoring sales trends.
Previous studies and existing systems, like those by Adekola et al. (2021), have shown that automation in laundry management can significantly reduce errors, enhance operational efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction. However, many of these systems are designed for large-scale businesses and are not designed for small local laundry shops. 
This study aims to address this gap by developing a web-based and app-based Laundry Management System that is simple, efficient, and specifically tailored to the needs of Bulacan State University students who temporarily reside in dormitories, apartments and boarding houses, laundry shop owners, and staff. The proposed system aims to automate order tracking and scheduling, payment processing, and customer management while providing real-time updates and secure digital records to improve overall service quality and business productivity.

# Project Context
  A significant portion of Bulacan State University students reside in dormitories, boarding houses, and apartments near the campus. Due to busy schedules and limited resources, many students struggle to manage their laundry items. The proposed Laundry Management System (LMS) addresses this by providing a convenient web and mobile-based management system that allows students and the general public to easily schedule laundry services, schedule pick-up and delivery services, track their orders, and process payments anytime.
Unlike existing laundry management systems that are designed mainly for large-scale operations, the proposed LMS is simple, affordable, and tailored for small local laundry shops catering to students and the general public. It offers real-time tracking, automated cost computation, and integrated dashboards for administrators. The system also combines Transaction Processing System (TPS) and Management Information System (MIS) features, enabling efficient daily transactions, report generation, and business performance monitoring.
The proposed LMS provides a modern, student-centered, and efficient solution that streamlines operations for laundry shop owners and staff while offering users a faster, more reliable, and accessible laundry service experience.

# General Objectives
  The  main objective of the study is to design and develop a mobile and web-based  Laundry Shop Management (LMS) System for students, more specifically Bulacan State University’s college students but available also for the general public that will mitigate the difficulties of managing laundry due to time constraint and lack of equipment so that people allocate their time on different activities.

# Purpose and Description
  The main purpose of this project is to create a system that will assist the students of Bulacan State University by providing a system that will conveniently manage their laundry through the Laundry Shop Management (LMS) System. Through this system, students are expected to face less hassle in handling their own laundry, allowing them to focus more of their time and attention on their academic or personal responsibilities.
The TPS (Transaction Processing System) features of the LMS allow students to schedule their laundry, track its progress, and choose between pick-up and delivery options. The system also supports both cash and cashless payment methods and automatically generates receipts for each transaction. The MIS (Management Information System) features focus on organizing and managing collected data by sorting, summarizing, and classifying records, generating reports, dashboard generation to view a summary of key information, and providing a search function for viewing laundry histories. 
In summary, these subsystems make the system a comprehensive and efficient platform for students to use as it provides real-time update and transparent tracking. The system also seeks to provide a more modern approach as opposed to the traditional and manual laundry process by offering a convenient and technologically advanced alternative customized for the students of Bulacan State University and its community.
